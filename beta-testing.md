## Beta Testing History 

## Sofia's Beta test feedback:

1, Overall, I loved the theme of the game. Monica nicely brought the actual animal crossing game to life with this creation. Firstly, I appreciated the fact that the game ran smooth, and was free of any glitches. Secondly, the various activities involved within the game such as fishing, and trading made the game so much more intriguing and exciting to play. The attention to detail was beyond what I imagined. For example, if you play the game in the morning, the sky will match your current, real-life setting. Similarily, if you play the game at night, it showed darker colors of the ocean to resemble nighttime. Additionally, in terms of trading, the rates changed continuously, allowing you to purchase items for cheaper. This was a really cool add-on. Additionally, I appreciated the fact that the game didn't end if I exited the website. Rather, I could resume the game if I came back on the same device. Lastly, communication between different animals within the game brought even more diversity to what the game had to offer. Overall, I believe this game was very nicely created and I can evidently see how much time and effort was put into making it. 

2,The only improvement I would suggest for the game is to add a little more instructions. I felt as thought because there was so many activities that you could do, sometimes I got lost trying to remember how a specific activity worked. However, this didn't greatly impact the objective of the game, thus it was only a minor issue. 


## Abigail’s Beta Test Feedback:

1, The composition of the game was exquisite, I really loved the way the graphics were so clear and it almost felt like a game I could play professionally on the web. The fish catching part was my favourite thing to do (flexing my 550 fishes I caught) but I really thought this game was well made. I also really adored the fact there was a character that played music in the game! I love how we could add our own music to enhance our gaming experience. Monica did a fantastic job in giving each of the little creatures a good narrative; they all had a correspondent job that made Us, or aka the character we play in the game, understand the concept of what to do and how to complete tasks. The owl stole my fishies… so I don’t like the owl CUZ HE MEAN but overall, well done! 

2, I really didn’t think there was much improvement needed for the game, but as Sofia also suggested, a little more instructions would be helpful also I noticed when playing the butterfly catching part of the game, the butterflies would always go of to the side of the screen rather than being in the middle like the fishes were (I’ll send Monica a video that I took to show what I mean by this) but I think if the the butterflies were in the middle it would be so much easier to catch them! Besides that, I really enjoyed everything else about the game, and these minor issues didn’t bother me from the overall experience!

Easy interation and reading, good concept, might need developing on game graphics.
