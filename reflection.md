# Reflection
## Advice to self if I do a project like this again
    If I were ever to built a game with JS again, I would highly recommend keeping track of all the local storage variables ahead of time. Since I was hesitant to work on saving data right from the beginning, I find sorting through hundreds line so codes to find the variables I need to store is a big hassle. Another suggestion, though minor, is to stop being too ambitious and add more functions than necessary. I ended up spending much more time and effort than I initally thought I should put in. Not that it is bad, but not having a clear guidelines of what I want and scaling it out of proportion was not my objective.

## Hardest Part of Project
    I don't find much of the project challenging since I choose really reasonable functions to implemented and the Play p5js library was fairly easy to get a good grip on. But the most time-consuming, hence tough for a fairly impatience like me, is to make sure events don't trigger at the same time when the same keys/functions is pressed. I would say I have the most trouble and spend the most time on the catching function where I make the fish rod and bug net 'expired' after usages and spawning fishes every time the play log in to play the function. Also, saving local storage is a lot of works since I was hesitant at the start to do it along the varibles I created as I should have.

## Did you Complete the Needs to Have List?
    Yes, I completed all of my Needs to Have list though given that I also tweak it a bit after changing my mind a few times about the direction of my game. I also completed 2/3 of my Nice to Have List.
 
 ## What are you Most Proud of?
    I think what I'm proud of is not necessary due to how complex and fancy my codes are but to my personal preferences. I'm most proud of KK Slider playing music function and the time changing aspect of my game(as certain functions and items only appear at a certain time). Other than that, I'm proud of myself for managing my time wisely and finish this large scale project timely!
